# Advertisement-of-company-website

The project analyses the Advertisement dataset of a company website to the probability of the internet user clicking on the advertisement 

Since in this project, I am trying to seperate the customer's interaction with the firm on its social media platform, I applied a classifcation algorithm (Logistic Regression) to gather insights from the data. 

The coefficient matrix of the model implemented is

            precision    recall  f1-score   support

          0       0.87      0.96      0.91       162
          1       0.96      0.86      0.91       168
